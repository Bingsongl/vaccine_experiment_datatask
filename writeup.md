# Writeup 

This section will explain the rationale and mechanisms for generating the data and underlying information.

**Abstract:** This project will simulate the results of different COVID-19 interventions while considering the networked nature of social media and network effects of COVID-19 treatments.


## Demographic Information
This project assumes that demographic information of the survey respondents are fully exogenous and representative of a hypothetical population. While this project understands that this is not necessarily representative of real-life populations, the generation mechanism will be predominately based on a uniform distribution for the sake of simplicity.

|Field|Denotation|Generation Mechanism|References|
|--|--|--|--|
|`demographic_age`|Age in years|$X \sim Uniform(21,80)$|
|`demographic_income`|Annual income in thousands of dollars|$X \sim PowerLaw(2), Y = 5 * 10^6X$|https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~xgabaix/papers/powerLaws.pdf|
|`demographic_education`|Highest educational degree obtained (no schooling, high school, bachelors or associates, postgraduate)|$X \sim Uniform (0,3)$|
|`demographic_unobs_grp`|Simulates membership in an unobserved demographic group. This assumes that different dimensions of social identity can be compressed into low-dimensional approximations|$X \sim Uniform(\{A, B, C, D, E\})$|


## Attitudes Towards Vaccination
These related background questions will be generated by combining an individual's intrinsically held beliefs plus their demographic information, using the following formula and relationships

$$p(j) = \Sigma_i{p(i)w(i,j)} + \beta + \epsilon$$
- Influence from demographics $\Sigma_i{p(i)w(i,j)}$, with:
    - Magnitude of a demographic feature's influence on views $w(i,j) \sim U(-0.25,0.25)$
    - Normalized value of a demographic feature $p(i) \in (0,1)$
- Intrinsically held belief $\beta \sim U(3,7)$
- Random error term $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$

To make these values seem like survey responses, $p(j)$ will also be cleaned:
- In the rare case that this value exceeds the range (1,10) due to the random error term, the value will be forced back into the range
- Each value will be rounded to the nearest integer


|Field|Description|Possible Responses|Generation Mechanism|Relation to Outcome Variable|Source|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|`att_covid`|How concerned are you about the COVID-19 pandemic?|1 (least concerned) - 10 (most concerned)|||
|`att_vaccine`|In your view, how effective are COVID-19 vaccines?|1 (not effective at all) - 10 (highly effective)|||
|`att_safety`|In your view, how safe are COVID-19 vaccines?|1 (not safe) - 10 (very safe)|||
|`att_unobserved`|Other unobserved factors that influence one's propensity for vaccination|1(dislike vaccines) - 10 (like vaccines)|||

Since these questions all measure qualitatively different opinions, the model will assume that responses to these questions are independent of each other.

## Network Component
To simulate the spread of vaccination behavior in a social network, this component will simulate a facebook social network using a modified Bianconi–Barabási network that has following characteristics. Due to limited computational resources, we assume that this survey full captures a complete and self-contained facebook social network.

**Homophily:** People who are more demographically similar to each other are more likely to become friends with each other.
- This will be implemented via a similarity matrix between each using euclidean distance of their demographics

**Preferential Attachment:** People are more likely to make friends with people that are more popular.
- To generate this Bianconi–Barabási network, . Each time we add a node, the probability of it connecting to node i is:
$$p(i)

**Attitude Diffusion:** Each person begins by holding a set of attitudes about COVID vaccination based on their intrinsically-held views. They then influence (and are influenced by) their friends' attitudes.


## Modelling the Treatment Effect


## Outcome Variable: vaccination
The relationships assumed can be seen in the directed acyclic graph, using the same formulation
$$p(j) = \Sigma_i{p(i)w(i,j)} + \beta + \epsilon$$
